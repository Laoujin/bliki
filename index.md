### Public Speaking

Sharing is caring. I've given talks about Html5, Git, Design Patterns and React.


### Open Source Projects

[Consultant invoicing][project-confac]  
Small invoicing application aimed at consultants specifically. Create invoice pdfs from pug + css.
Technologies: React/Redux, Koa, MongoDb  
There is a [demo][confac-demo]! (without backend:)

[Something Fishy][project-bliki]  
Not sure what this will become, really. A blog for sure but I do plan to revisit old posts and rework them
when new information becomes available, or rework them should I've changed my mind about some aspects.  

The original plan was to blog about the 70 Pragmatic Programmer tips but it looks like I've started with posting
tutorials I've accumulated in the last years instead. Old blog drafts, written notes etc might also be reworked and posted
(if the subject is still relevant:).


[Pingpong Club Erembodegem][project-ttc]  
Frontend: React, Redux, Webpack, Bluebird, JWT, ImmutableJS  
Backend: C# WebApi, SignalR  


[Sangu Package and TWTactics][project-sangu]
